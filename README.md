## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stacks

Here are the main technologies used in this project:

- **Java**: The main programming language used.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework used for creating standalone, production-grade Spring based Applications.
- **MySQL**: Database used for data persistence.
- **Hibernate**: ORM tool for data manipulation.
- **Docker**: Containerization tool.
- **AWS**: Cloud services for deployment and storage.

## üå± Why Spring Boot
"I built the backend using Spring Boot because it provides a robust, opinionated framework perfect for microservice architectures. Its dependency injection, autoconfiguration, and starter dependencies allowed me to quickly scaffold the application code and configure components like security, data access, and web APIs.

Spring Boot showcases my abilities to rapidly develop and iterate on production-grade services. Its embedded Tomcat server streamlined deployment without needing to setup complex infrastructures. And features like actuator endpoints helped monitor and manage the app in production.

Overall, choosing Spring Boot aligned with modern application design patterns. It enabled scalable and resilient services to support the complex and evolving demands of Roamify‚Äôs tour offerings. My expertise in leveraging Spring Boot demonstrates how I create adaptable, enterprise-level backend solutions.‚Äù
